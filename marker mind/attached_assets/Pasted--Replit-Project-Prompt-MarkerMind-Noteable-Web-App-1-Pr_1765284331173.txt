🚀 Replit Project Prompt: MarkerMind / Noteable Web App
🎯 1. Project Overview
Create a feature-rich web application that digitally replicates the experience of using a physical whiteboard with colorful sticky notes and hand-drawn marker elements. The application must be interactive, aesthetically pleasing, and capable of saving/loading board states.

🏷️ 2. Branding & Aesthetic Goals
App Name: MarkerMind or Noteable.

Core Aesthetic: Whiteboard-styled background (light gray/white canvas). All non-note text and lines must resemble thick, slightly wobbly strokes made by a dry-erase marker.

Sticky Note Visuals: Use a fixed palette (Yellow, Pink, Blue, Green, Orange). Notes must appear slightly 3D (via box-shadow) and apply with a randomized rotation (±5 
∘
 ) for a realistic, haphazard look.

Font: Implement a custom font that mimics handwriting or marker text for both sticky notes and drawn elements.

🛠️ 3. Technical Requirements & Stack
Stack: A full-stack setup is preferred (e.g., React or Vue.js for the frontend, Node.js/Express for a potential API, even if unused initially).

Canvas Implementation: Use SVG or HTML Canvas for the main drawing surface to manage complex elements, drag-and-drop, and line drawing.

Persistence (MVP): Use Browser Local Storage to handle saving and loading the board state via JSON serialization.

📌 4. Core Features to Implement
Draggable Sticky Notes:

Fully functional drag-and-drop movement.

Editing: Double-click to modify text content.

Customization: Controls for changing color, shape (Square, Rectangle, Circle), and deleting the note.

Basic Drawing Tool: Implement a tool to draw freehand lines and simple, segmented shapes (like tables) that look like marker strokes.

Template Structure: Implement the UI framework for the following two initial presets:

The "Rocket Launch" Roadmap: A 3-section horizontal framework (Fueling, Ignition, Orbit).

Persona Profile Card: A large, structured card with pre-drawn fields (Name, Goals, Frustrations).

💾 5. Data Structure (JSON Schema)
The entire board state must be saved as a single JSON object in Local Storage, adhering to the following structure:

JSON

{
  "boardId": "unique_id_string",
  "boardName": "User-Defined Board Title",
  "dateLastSaved": "ISO 8601 Date/Time String",
  "elements": {
    "stickyNotes": [
      {
        "id": "note-xxx",
        "type": "stickyNote",
        "text": "Note content goes here.",
        "x": 350,
        "y": 120,
        "color": "yellow",
        "shape": "rectangle",
        "rotation": 3.5
      }
      // ... other sticky notes
    ],
    "drawings": [
      {
        "id": "line-yyy",
        "type": "freehandLine",
        "color": "black",
        "thickness": 8,
        "path": [
          { "x": 50, "y": 100 }, 
          { "x": 55, "y": 105 } 
          // ... array of coordinates
        ]
      }
      // ... other drawing elements
    ]
  }
}
